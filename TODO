- We need a predefined, interface-specific state for each socket 
  to handle the following issues:
    All backends require the socket to make modifications; otherwise:
    a) epoll: to my knowledge, epoll is fine as-is
    b) poll: we need the array index to make deletions
    c) kevent: we need the current event state to make deletions
